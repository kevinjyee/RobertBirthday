        <p id="message">"Dear Robert, <br> Happy 22nd birthday! These past 4 years would not have been the same without you.
            Having a friend like you is one the greatest blessings of my life. You have always supported me - through the good times
            and the bad. I will never forget all the moments that you have went out of your way to show that you care.
            <br>
            You are such an amazing person. Someone with such great drive, passion, and fun-filled personality. I'll miss all the long nights,
            study grinds, fun adventures, and laughs we have shared.
            I know I have made a friend for life. Good luck my brother, I can't wait to see you do great things.
            <br>
            P.S. I'm sure you remembered, but this was the first photo ever that we took together - when we were still young, wide-eyed, freshmans.
            Our journey from that moment has been great ever since."</p>
